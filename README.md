# Thelio Superfan Wallpapers
Wallpapers inspired by the [Thelio Hardware from System76](https://system76.com/desktops)

These wallpapers are perfect for that minimalistic look. Wallpapers so pretty you wouldn't want to cover them up with icons even if you could. Just like the hardware they are based on these wallpapers come in two wood varients, walnut and maple. They also come with two options per wood type with the "Thelio" text and without.
